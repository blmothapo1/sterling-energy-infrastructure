        <h1>The Road Ahead</h1>
        <p class="subhead">We're building more than charging stations. We're creating destinations. Places where technology meets humanity. Where every stop powers not just vehicles, but the future of sustainable travel.</p>
      </header>
      <div>
        <h2>Foundation (2025–2030)</h2>
        <p>It starts in Lehi. Our flagship hub rises with universal fast charging—NACS and CCS, no compromises. This isn't just infrastructure. It's a statement.</p>
        <p>Within four years, profitability. Not through shortcuts, but through precision: high-traffic retail partnerships, disciplined operations, and amenities that matter. Fresh food. Workspace. Safe, brilliantly lit environments where families feel secure at any hour.</p>
        <p>From there, we expand across the Wasatch Front—Provo, Orem, South Jordan. Each location designed to become a preferred stop, not a necessary one. We're building brand loyalty the hard way: by earning it, every single charge.</p>

        <h2>Scale (2030–2035)</h2>
        <p>The network extends. Utah to Idaho. Nevada along I-15 and I-84. But we're not just building more—we're building smarter.</p>
        <p>Solar canopies and onsite battery storage cut demand peaks, improve uptime, reduce costs. Energy independence at every hub. We launch our own retail concepts: SEI-branded experiences that turn wait time into welcome time.</p>
        <p>Fleet programs arrive. Rideshare drivers. Delivery logistics. Dedicated bays, streamlined billing. We're becoming essential infrastructure for the commercial EV revolution.</p>

        <h2>Leadership (2035–2040)</h2>
        <p>We move into Colorado. Arizona. New Mexico. Each market brings new partnerships with cities and municipalities who see what we see: charging infrastructure as community infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Autonomous vehicles are coming. Smart grids are evolving. We're ready. Our hubs integrate seamlessly with tomorrow's technology because we're building for tomorrow, today.</p>
        <p>Recognition follows execution. We become the Mountain West's benchmark for safe, reliable, experience-first EV infrastructure. And we give back: the SEI Foundation launches to support clean energy education and workforce training. Building the future means investing in the people who'll shape it.</p>

        <h2>Vision (2040–2045)</h2>
        <p>Coast to coast. A nationwide network of destination hubs. We've become synonymous with reliability, safety, and exceptional guest experience. When drivers think premium charging, they think Sterling.</p>
        <p>We help write the standards. Shape best practices. Expand into Canada and Mexico. Our infrastructure crosses borders because sustainable transportation knows no boundaries.</p>
        <p>And through it all, we deliver returns—durable, long-horizon value for investors and communities alike. Not quarterly thinking. Generational building.</p>

        <aside class="callout note"><strong>Technical excellence:</strong> In Lehi, we coordinate with <em>Lehi Power</em> for seamless interconnection and service planning. Because great infrastructure requires great partnerships.</aside>
