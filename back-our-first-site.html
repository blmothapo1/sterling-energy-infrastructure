      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      
      <h3>Will this work with my EV?</h3>
      <p>Yes – our hub will support both CCS and NACS (Tesla) connectors to ensure compatibility with virtually all electric vehicles on the market today and in the future.</p>
      
      <h3>What is the timeline?</h3>
      <p>We aim to break ground soon after securing final approvals and funding, with construction lasting several months. We'll keep our community updated on major milestones throughout the process.</p>
      
      <h3>Is it safe at night?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Safety is a core design principle. Our site will feature comprehensive canopy lighting, monitored environments, and 24/7 support to ensure drivers feel secure at any time of day.</p>
      
      <h3>Are there financial returns for crowdfunding supporters?</h3>
      <p>No financial returns are offered through our crowdfunding campaign. This is about supporting public infrastructure improvements and helping build the EV charging network our community needs. For investment opportunities with financial returns, please contact us directly.</p>
